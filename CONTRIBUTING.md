## üé® Code Style

### Python Code Style
- **Formatter**: Black (line length: 88)
- **Linter**: Ruff with default configuration
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions
- **Imports**: Organized with isort
- **Docstrings**: Google-style format

### Example
```python
def save_memory(entry: MemoryEntry, storage_path: Path) -> tuple[str, Path]:
    """Save a memory entry to file storage.
    
    Args:
        entry: The memory entry to save
        storage_path: Directory to save the memory file
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (memory_id, file_path)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If entry validation fails
        IOError: If file cannot be written
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Commit Message Format
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add memory filtering by date range
fix(storage): handle file permission errors gracefully
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(embeddings): add unit tests for similarity search
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_storage.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=mcp_server --cov=cli

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Test Structure
```python
def test_save_memory_creates_file():
    """Test that saving a memory creates the expected markdown file."""
    # Arrange
    entry = MemoryEntry(project="test", category="testing", content="Test content")
    
    # Act
    memory_id, file_path = storage.save_memory(entry)
    
    # Assert
    assert file_path.exists()
    assert memory_id is not None
```
